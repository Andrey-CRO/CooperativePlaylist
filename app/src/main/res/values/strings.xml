    Wi-Fi Direct (P2P) is used to connect Android devices together.\n\n
    The person being connected to is the playlist/group owner.\n
    The owner explicitly controls the playlist.\n
    Peers connected to the owner can add songs to the playlist queue or vote to skip the current song (majority required).\n\n
    As a shortcut, several actions can be performed by swiping:\n
        swipe top - display playlist\n
        swipe bottom - discover nearby devices\n
        swipe right - add song to playlist\n
        swipe left - vote to skip\n
